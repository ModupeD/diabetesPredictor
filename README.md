# ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

Ever wondered if a computer could predict whether someone might have **diabetes**‚Äîjust by looking at a few health stats?  
This mini-project explores how **machine learning** can help make that guess!

## üí° What is Diabetes?

**Diabetes** is a condition where the body struggles to regulate blood sugar levels. Traditionally, doctors diagnose it using lab tests.  
In this project, we build a **machine learning model** that analyzes health data (like age, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.) to *predict* whether someone is likely to have diabetes.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is an educational demo‚Äînot a real diagnostic tool! Always consult a medical professional for health concerns.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning, Simplified

Imagine you studied thousands of math quizzes with the answers already filled in. Eventually, you‚Äôd start noticing patterns and could predict answers to new questions.  
That‚Äôs essentially what machine learning does: it **learns from past data** to make predictions about new cases.

We use two beginner-friendly models in this project:

| Model                  | What's the idea?                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Logistic Regression**| Tries to draw a straight boundary that separates people with and without diabetes.|
| **k-Nearest Neighbors**| Looks at the closest *k* similar people and goes with the majority vote.          |
