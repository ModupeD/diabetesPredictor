# Diabetes Prediction — Explained for Teens

Ever wondered if a computer can guess whether someone might have **diabetes** just by looking at a few health numbers?  
This mini-project shows how!

## 🌟 What's Diabetes, Super Quick?

Diabetes is a condition where a person's blood sugar is too high. Doctors usually do a blood test to check.  
In this project, instead of a doctor we let a **machine-learning model** look at health info (like age, blood pressure, etc.) and *predict* if someone probably has diabetes.

> **No worries:** This is just a demo. Real doctors still make the final call!

## 🤖 Machine Learning In Plain English

Imagine you have thousands of math quizzes where every question already has the right answer. If you study them long enough, you start spotting patterns and can guess answers to new questions. That "pattern-spotting brain" is what we call a *machine-learning model*.

We use two beginner-friendly models:

| Model | One-sentence idea |
|-------|------------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Draws a straight line that tries to split the "diabetic" dots from the "not diabetic" dots. |
| **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Looks at the *k* closest people to you; if most of them have diabetes, it guesses you do too. |

## 📦 What's Inside This Repo?

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `diabetes_prediction.py` | Runs the whole pipeline in the terminal—loads data, trains models, prints results, draws ROC curves. |
| `diabetes_app.py` | A **Streamlit** web app with pretty visuals and step-by-step explanations. |
| `requirements.txt` | List of Python packages you need. |

## 🚀 How To Run It (5-minute setup)

```bash
# 1. Open a terminal in the project folder
# 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install the needed packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4a. Run the quick terminal version
python3 diabetes_prediction.py

#    OR
# 4b. Launch the interactive web app
streamlit run diabetes_app.py
```

When the web app starts, a browser tab pops up.

## 🔍 What You'll See

1. **Overview page** – a friendly intro.
2. **Dataset page** – peek at the first few rows and learn what each column means.
3. **Pre-processing page** – see how we fix missing values and scale numbers.
4. **Train & Evaluate page** – watch the models learn, then compare their accuracy and cool ROC curves (a fancy score graph).

## 🗂️ The Data

We use the open-source **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** (768 people, 8 health measurements + 1 result column). It's super common in ML tutorials because it's easy to understand and doesn't need any personal info.

| Feature | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Pregnancies | Times the person has been pregnant |
| Glucose | Blood sugar level |
| BloodPressure | Diastolic blood pressure (lower number) |
| SkinThickness | Thickness of skin fold on the arm |
| Insulin | Insulin level two hours after a sugary drink |
| BMI | Body Mass Index (weight for height) |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | How much diabetes runs in the family |
| Age | In years |
| Outcome | 1 = diabetic, 0 = not |

## 💡 Why Does This Matter?

• Shows how data turns into insights.

• Teaches basic ML steps: *clean → split → train → test → evaluate*.

• Lets you experiment—try changing the test size, try different *k* values, or add your own health data for fun.
